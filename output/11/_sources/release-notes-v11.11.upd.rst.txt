*Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL* 11.11 Update
================================================================================

:Date: April 12, 2021
:Installation: `Installing Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL <https://www.percona.com/doc/postgresql/11/installing.html>`_


This update of |pdp| includes the latest version of `pg_stat_monitor <https://github.com/percona/pg_stat_monitor>`_ 0.8.1 - the statistics collection tool for PostgreSQL. ``pg_stat_monitor`` is available as the Tech Preview Feature [#]_ and is supplied in the set of extensions within |pdp|.

We welcome your feedback on your experience with ``pg_stat_monitor`` in the `public JIRA project <https://jira.percona.com/projects/DISTPG>`_.


.. [#] Tech Preview Features are not yet ready for enterprise use and are not included in support via |SLA|. They are included in this release, so that users can provide feedback prior to the full release of the feature in a future |GA| release (or removal of the feature if it is deemed not useful). This functionality can change (APIs, CLIs, etc.) from tech preview to GA.
