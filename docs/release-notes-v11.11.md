Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL is also shipped with the [libpq](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/libpq.html) library. It contains “a set of
library functions that allow client programs to pass queries to the PostgreSQL
backend server and to receive the results of these queries.” [^2]

This release is based on [PostgreSQL 11.11](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/11.11/).


[^1]: Tech Preview Features are not yet ready for enterprise use and are not included in support via SLA. They are included in this release, so that users can provide feedback prior to the full release of the feature in a future GA release (or removal of the feature if it is deemed not useful). This functionality can change (APIs, CLIs, etc.) from tech preview to GA.
