Find the full list of supported platforms on the Percona Software and Platform Lifecycle page . Like many other Percona products, we recommend installing Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL from Percona repositories by using the percona-release utility. The percona-release utility automatically enables the required repository for you so you can easily install and update Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL packages and their dependencies through the package manager of your operating system. The installation process includes the following steps: Install percona-release Enable the repository Install the packages Start the postgresql service Connect to the server Repositories overview \u00b6 There are two repositories available for Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL. We recommend installing Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL from the Major Release repository (e.g. ppg-13 ) as it includes the latest version packages. Whenever a package is updated, the package manager of your operating system detects that and prompts you to update. As long as you update all Distribution packages at the same time, you can ensure that the packages you\u2019re using have been tested and verified by Percona. The Minor Release repository includes a particular minor release of the database and all of the packages that were tested and verified to work with that minor release (e.g. ppg-13.1 ). You may choose to install Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL from the Minor Release repository if you have decided to standardize on a particular release which has passed rigorous testing procedures and which has been verified to work with your applications. This allows you to deploy to a new host and ensure that you\u2019ll be using the same version of all the Distribution packages, even if newer releases exist in other repositories. The disadvantage of using a Minor Release repository is that you are locked in this particular release. When potentially critical fixes are released in a later minor version of the database, you will not be prompted for an upgrade by the package manager of your operating system. You would need to change the configured repository in order to install the upgrade. Install percona-release \u00b6 Install percona-release utility. If you have installed it before, update it to the latest version. Refer to Percona repositories documentation for installation / update instructions. Enable the repository \u00b6 As soon as percona-release is installed or up-to-date, enable the repository for Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL ( ppg-13 ). We recommend using the set up command as it enables the specified repository and updates the platform\u2019s package manager database. To install the latest version of Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL, enable the Major Release repository using the following command: $ sudo percona-release setup ppg-13 To install a specific minor version of Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL, enable the Minor release repository. For example, to install Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL 13.1, enable the ppg-13.1 repository using the following command: $ sudo percona-release setup ppg-13.1 Install Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL packages \u00b6 After you\u2019ve installed percona-release and enabled the desired repository, install Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL using the commands of your package manager (the procedure differs depending on the package manager of your operating system). On Debian and Ubuntu using apt \u00b6 Note On Debian and other systems that use the apt package manager, such as Ubuntu, components of Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL 13 can only be installed together with the server shipped by Percona (percona-postgresql-13). If you wish to use Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL, uninstall the PostgreSQL package provided by your distribution (postgresql-13) and then install the chosen components from Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL. Platform Specific Notes \u00b6 On Debian 9 (stretch), you need to enable the llvm repository Install the percona-postgresql-13 package using apt-get install . $ sudo apt-get install percona-postgresql-13 Note that this package will not install the components. Use the following commands to install components\u2019 packages: Install pg_repack : $ sudo apt-get install percona-postgresql-13-repack Install pgAudit : $ sudo apt-get install percona-postgresql-13-pgaudit Install pgBackRest : $ sudo apt-get install percona-pgbackrest Install Patroni : $ sudo apt-get install percona-patroni Install pg_stat_monitor : $ sudo apt-get install percona-pg-stat-monitor13 Note You need to set up pg_stat_monitor in order to use it with Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL.

For more information, refer to Enabling extensions . Starting the service \u00b6 The installation process automatically initializes the default database. Thus, to start Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL, use the following command: $ sudo pg_ctlcluster 13 main start Next steps: connect to PostgreSQL . On Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS using yum \u00b6 Platform Specific Notes \u00b6 If you intend to install Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL on Red Hat Enterprise Linux v8, disable the postgresql module: $ sudo dnf module disable postgresql On CentOS 7, you should install the epel-release package: $ sudo yum -y install epel-release $ sudo yum repolist Install the percona-postgresql-13 package using yum install . $ sudo yum install percona-postgresql13-server Note that this package will not install the components.

To complete the installation and start Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL, initialize the database using the following command: /usr/pgsql-13/bin/postgresql-13-setup initdb Start the PostgreSQL service: $ sudo systemctl start postgresql-13 Enabling extensions \u00b6 Some extensions require additional configuration before using them with Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL. This sections provides configuration instructions per extension. pgBadger Enable the following options in postgresql.conf configuration file before starting the service: log_min_duration_statement = 0 log_line_prefix = '%t [%p]: ' log_checkpoints = on log_connections = on log_disconnections = on log_lock_waits = on log_temp_files = 0 log_autovacuum_min_duration = 0 log_error_verbosity = default For details about each option, see pdBadger documentation . pgAudit set-user Add the set-user to shared_preload_libraries in postgresql.conf . The recommended way is to use the ALTER SYSTEM command. Connect to psql and use the following command: $ ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_preload_libraries = 'set-user'; Start / restart the server to apply the configuration. You can fine-tune user behavior with the custom parameters supplied with the extension. wal2json After the installation, enable the following option in postgresql.conf configuration file before starting the service: wal_level = logical Connect to the PostgreSQL server \u00b6 By default, postgres user and postgres database are created in PostgreSQL upon its installation and initialization.

Overview \u00b6 pg_stat_monitor is a PostgreSQL Query Performance Monitoring tool. It collects statistics data and writes it in a storage unit called bucket . The data is added and stored in a bucket for the defined period \u2013 the bucket lifetime. You can specify the following: The number of buckets. Together they form a bucket chain. Bucket size. This is the amount of shared memory allocated for buckets. Memory is divided equally among buckets. Bucket lifetime. When a bucket lifetime expires, pg_stat_monitor resets all statistics and writes the data in the next bucket in the chain. When the last bucket\u2019s lifetime expires, pg_stat_monitor returns to the first bucket. Important The contents of the bucket will be overwritten. In order not to lose the data, make sure to read the bucket before pg_stat_monitor starts writing new data to it. Setup \u00b6 After the installation , pg_stat_monitor requires additional setup in order to use it with PostgreSQL. The setup steps are the following: Add pg_stat_monitor in the shared_preload_libraries configuration parameter. The recommended way to modify PostgreSQL configuration file is using the ALTER SYSTEM command. Connect to psql and use the following command: $ ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_monitor'; The parameter value is written to the postgresql.auto.conf file which is read in addition with postgresql.conf file. Start or restart the PostgreSQL instance to enable pg_stat_monitor . Use the following command for restart: On Debian and Ubuntu: $ sudo systemctl restart postgresql.service On Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS: $ sudo systemctl restart postgresql-13 Create the extension. Connect to psql and use the following command: $ CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_monitor; Usage \u00b6 pg_stat_monitor provides two views: pg_stat_monitor is the view where statistics data is presented. pg_stat_monitor_settings shows available configuration options which you can change. To learn more, see Changing the configuration . Use the following query to view what metrics pg_stat_monitor can collect: $ \\d pg_stat_monitor; Output View \"public.pg_stat_monitor\" Column | Type | Collation | Nullable | Default ---------------------+--------------------------+-----------+----------+--------- bucket | integer | | | bucket_start_time | timestamp with time zone | | | userid | oid | | | dbid | oid | | | client_ip | inet | | | queryid | text | | | query | text | | | application_name | text | | | relations | text[] | | | cmd_type | text[] | | | elevel | integer | | | sqlcode | integer | | | message | text | | | plans | bigint | | | plan_total_time | double precision | | | plan_min_timei | double precision | | | plan_max_time | double precision | | | plan_mean_time | double precision | | | plan_stddev_time | double precision | | | calls | bigint | | | total_time | double precision | | | min_time | double precision | | | max_time | double precision | | | mean_time | double precision | | | stddev_time | double precision | | | rows | bigint | | | shared_blks_hit | bigint | | | shared_blks_read | bigint | | | shared_blks_dirtied | bigint | | | shared_blks_written | bigint | | | local_blks_hit | bigint | | | local_blks_read | bigint | | | local_blks_dirtied | bigint | | | local_blks_written | bigint | | | temp_blks_read | bigint | | | temp_blks_written | bigint | | | blk_read_time | double precision | | | blk_write_time | double precision | | | resp_calls | text[] | | | cpu_user_time | double precision | | | cpu_sys_time | double precision | | | For example, to view the IP address of the client application that made the query, run the following command: $ SELECT userid::regrole, datname, substr(query,0, 50) AS query, calls, client_ip FROM pg_stat_monitor, pg_database WHERE dbid = oid; userid | datname | query | calls | client_ip ----------+----------+---------------------------------------------------+-------+----------- postgres | postgres | select bucket, bucket_start_time, query,calls fro | 1 | 127.0.0.1 postgres | postgres | SELECT c.relchecks, c.relkind, c.relhasindex, c.r | 1 | 127.0.0.1 postgres | postgres | SELECT userid, total_time, min_time, max_time, | 1 | 127.0.0.1 Find more usage examples in pg_stat_monitor User Guide .
